Engineering Team | San Francisco, CA
WHY WE'RE HERE 
At Dropbox, we’re building the home for people’s most important stuff—their photos, docs, and other treasured information. Our small team of engineers builds the thousands of complex parts that seamlessly handle over a billion files a day for over 200 million users, while delivering a product that's easy enough for your grandparents to use. While we've built a great foundation, we've only just begun.

HOW WE WORK 
Our engineering team is passionate about building awesome products at massive scale. We've developed a set of values that enable us to do this. Specifically, we write great software and sweat the details, relentlessly focus on impact, and create an enduring culture. Creating elegant products begins with lots of hacking and iteration to explore the problem space. It culminates in careful attention to edge cases and error handling, polished code, and great tests to ensure that we ship reliable code that never compromises data integrity or security. Every Dropbox software release improves millions of lives, and you'll find a high petabyte-to-engineer ratio here. We're aggressive about shipping high-leverage projects, even if they're risky or novel. We care deeply about collaboration, feedback, and iteration. Trust and respect are deeply rooted in our engineering culture. 

WHAT WE BUILD 
At the heart of Dropbox lies the largest networked filesystem in history. We routinely tackle audacious challenges, often against competitors who have 10-50x our resources. On top of this foundation, we're creating products that enable people to do amazing things with their stuff across all their devices. (See responsibilities.)

Responsibilities
We're building infrastructure to manage metadata for hundreds of billions of files, hundreds of petabytes of user data, and millions of concurrent connections.
The Dropbox Platform is the fabric connecting over 100 thousand of the world's apps, devices, and services. Our team is redefining "sync" for a mobile era. (See the inaugural DBX conference for more.)
We relentlessly measure and optimize, and we're building one of industry's most advanced analytics platforms to derive meaning from vast amounts of data.
Our core mobile team crafts the data and networking layers that enable rapid product innovation across Android, iOS, and mobile web.
Our lightweight clients push the boundaries of OS integration on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, and Linux. For example, on OS X we had to reverse-engineer the Finder to show current file sync status, and on Android and iOS we’ve optimized JSON parsing and built custom bitmap caches to present lightning-fast views of tens of thousands of photos.
People store and share billions of memories on Dropbox, and we love making these experiences delightful, from our mobile photo uploaders and web albums to a host of exciting features that will launch over the next few months.
Millions of businesses around the world run on Dropbox, from your neighborhood corner store all the way up to Fortune 500 companies. We're building Dropbox for Business to help teams be more productive and collaborative.
We're reinventing email with Mailbox, a mobile-first inbox that helps people focus and simplify their lives even more.
Requirements
We’re looking for brilliant engineers with 0-2 years experience who are hungry to take Dropbox even further. If these large-scale projects resonate, we'd love to learn more about you and find out if we can work together.
