Apache Spark is an open-source data analytics cluster computing framework originally developed in the AMPLab at UC Berkeley.[1] Spark fits into the Hadoop open-source community, building on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).[2] However, Spark is not tied to the two-stage MapReduce paradigm, and promises performance up to 100 times faster than Hadoop MapReduce for certain applications.[3] Spark provides primitives for in-memory cluster computing that allows user programs to load data into a cluster's memory and query it repeatedly, making it well suited to machine learning algorithms.[4] 
Spark became an Apache Top-Level Project in February 2014,[5] and was previously an Apache Incubator project since June 2013.[6] It has received code contributions from large companies that use Spark, including Yahoo! and Intel[1] as well as small companies and startups such as Conviva,[7] Quantifind,[8] ClearStory Data,[9] Ooyala[10] and many more.[11] By Mar 2014, over 150 individual developers had contributed code to Spark, representing over 30 different companies.[12] Prior to joining Apache Incubator, versions 0.7 and earlier were licensed under the BSD License.[13]
