Company Overview

Medallia was founded on a simple idea: that companies can win by putting the customer before everything else. Our SaaS platform does this by capturing customer feedback, analyzing it in real-time, and then delivering it to everyone in a company — from the c-suite to the frontline — to help them improve. We’re now considered the leaders in a space we helped to create, we’re Sequoia backed, and we’re growing like crazy, doubling in size every 12 months. We’ve got a culture focused on smarts, kindness, continual learning, irreverence… and our people love it. A full 95% of our employees would recommend us to their friends.

Come find out why.

Medallia focuses on enabling businesses to understand their customers by gathering feedback data from a variety of sources, applying natural language processing and other analyses, and creating instantaneous, intuitive, and insightful visualizations. Our software engineers work on a wide array of problems, including distributed data storage, topic classification, sentiment analysis, OLAP technology, social media data collection, and more.

The key to our success as market leader in the CEM industry is technology. Our real-time, in-house, patented OLAP engine allows sub-second queries on 150-million-row datasets, and our text analysis suite includes topic classification, sentiment analysis, and more.
